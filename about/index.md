# About Me


I'm a young Junior Gameplay Programmer eager to learn (and to master!) more and more.

I'm interested in lots of subjects and mediums such as [cinema](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPXZ5YH-3UQ5wo9f9FhfBPw98vxuM0Dlt), [music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPXZ5YH-3UQ6Qn_cdNdfPQGQ_8iHUVHqD), architecture, [video games](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPXZ5YH-3UQ7Nj_ExrvKzpfbxndoRbXj5), photography, [car](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPXZ5YH-3UQ4HaxuJn53EKe2GSYj2QH0C), restoration and so on.

I learned a lot about the making of video games as a gameplay programmer, working with each and every team involved in the development of a AAA game on PC and consoles (PS4 & Xbox One).

I had the luck to participate to the creation of the [Ubisoft Bordeaux](https://www.ubisoft.com/fr-FR/studio/bordeaux.aspx) studio which was an exhilarating experience and to grow as a Gameplay Programmer on a AAA production.

I experienced there how to build a game as big as [Ghost Recon Breakpoint](https://ghost-recon.ubisoft.com/game/fr-fr/breakpoint), working with hundreds of developers from several Ubisoft studios across Europe.
